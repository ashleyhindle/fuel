{"id":"b-35135f","title":"Stream agent output to disk continuously, not just at completion","description":"Currently agent output is buffered in memory (16KB cap) and only written to run record at completion. If process becomes zombie or crashes, output is lost.\n\nFix: Write stdout/stderr to disk as it streams in.\n\nFiles to modify:\n- app/Services/ProcessManager.php - already has file-based output, ensure it's used\n- app/Process/AgentProcess.php - add file paths, write incrementally\n- app/Commands/ConsumeCommand.php - ensure using the file-based capture\n\nImplementation:\n1. On spawn, create .fuel/processes/{taskId}/stdout.log and stderr.log\n2. In poll() or getIncrementalOutput(), append to files immediately\n3. On completion, copy final output to run record but files are already there\n4. On zombie/crash, output is preserved in files\n\nThis ensures output survives process failures.","created_at":"2026-01-10T10:26:19+00:00"}
{"id":"b-402ee3","title":"Add 'refactor' as valid task type","description":"Add 'refactor' to the list of valid task types.\n\nCurrent types: bug, feature, task, epic, chore, docs, test\nAdd: refactor\n\nFiles to modify:\n- app/Enums/TaskType.php (or wherever types are defined)\n- Any validation logic that checks task types\n\nRefactor is distinct from chore - it specifically means 'improve code structure without changing behavior'. Aligns with conventional commits (refactor:).","created_at":"2026-01-10T10:31:15+00:00"}
{"id":"b-7d1601","title":"Add browser/screenshot capability for agents to verify frontend work","description":"Agents working on frontend tasks can't verify their work visually. Add capability for agents to:\n\n1. Launch a headless browser (Puppeteer, Playwright, or similar)\n2. Take screenshots of specified URLs/pages\n3. View the screenshots to verify visual changes\n\nOptions to explore:\n- Puppeteer/Playwright via Node.js subprocess\n- browsershot PHP package (uses Puppeteer under the hood)\n- Selenium with headless Chrome\n- Built-in MCP browser tools if available\n\nIntegration points:\n- Add as a fuel command: `fuel screenshot <url> [--output=path]`\n- Or integrate into agent prompts: 'Use fuel screenshot to verify your changes'\n- Consider video recording for complex interactions\n\nThis enables visual regression testing and lets agents self-verify frontend work.","created_at":"2026-01-10T10:34:15+00:00"}
{"id":"b-8eaf1e","title":"Add --force flag to remove command to skip confirmation","description":"The 'fuel remove' command currently always prompts for confirmation, which breaks automation and piping.\n\nAdd a --force (-f) flag that skips the confirmation prompt.\n\nFile to modify: app/Commands/RemoveCommand.php\n\nChanges:\n1. Add option: $this->addOption('force', 'f', InputOption::VALUE_NONE, 'Skip confirmation prompt')\n2. In handle(): if ($this->option('force')) skip the confirm() call\n3. Keep existing behavior (prompt) as default for safety\n\nExample usage:\n- fuel remove f-xxxx --force  # No prompt\n- fuel remove f-xxxx -f       # No prompt  \n- fuel remove f-xxxx          # Prompts (current behavior)","created_at":"2026-01-10T10:13:11+00:00"}

Add option: $this->addOption('backlog', null, InputOption::VALUE_NONE, 'Add to backlog (alias for --someday)')\n2. In handle(): check $this->option('backlog') || $this->option('someday')\n3.
