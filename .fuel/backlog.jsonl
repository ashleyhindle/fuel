{"id":"b-7d1601","title":"Add browser/screenshot capability for agents to verify frontend work","description":"Agents working on frontend tasks can't verify their work visually. Add capability for agents to:\n\n1. Launch a headless browser (Puppeteer, Playwright, or similar)\n2. Take screenshots of specified URLs/pages\n3. View the screenshots to verify visual changes\n\nOptions to explore:\n- Puppeteer/Playwright via Node.js subprocess\n- browsershot PHP package (uses Puppeteer under the hood)\n- Selenium with headless Chrome\n- Built-in MCP browser tools if available\n\nIntegration points:\n- Add as a fuel command: `fuel screenshot <url> [--output=path]`\n- Or integrate into agent prompts: 'Use fuel screenshot to verify your changes'\n- Consider video recording for complex interactions\n\nThis enables visual regression testing and lets agents self-verify frontend work.","created_at":"2026-01-10T10:34:15+00:00"}
{"id":"b-812288","title":"Consider refactoring reviews to be tasks that consume picks up","description":"Current review system spawns processes directly with in-memory tracking. Cleaner approach: triggerReview() creates a task with type=review, consume picks it up like any other task. Benefits: survives restarts, 'fuel review' just queues a task, simpler model.

{"id":"b-9702a9","title":"Automated run scoring by review agent","description":"Review agent scores completed runs automatically (not manual human ratings).\n\nScoring criteria:\n- Follow-up fixes needed (fewer = better)\n- Tests passed first time\n- Code quality (linting, patterns)\n- Task completion accuracy vs description\n\nConfig additions:\n- reviewer: agent that reviews completed work and scores\n- Could be cheaper model for cost efficiency\n\nStorage: scores table in agent.db\nUses: agent comparison, routing optimization, cost/quality analysis\n\nRelated: Phase 4 (Auto-Review)","created_at":"2026-01-10T11:53:57+00:00"}
