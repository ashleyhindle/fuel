# Fuel Agent Configuration
# Routes tasks to different agents based on complexity
# All agents use: -p for prompt, --model for model

complexity:
  trivial:
    agent: cursor-agent
    model: composer-1

  simple:
    agent: cursor-agent
    model: composer-1

  moderate:
    agent: claude
    model: sonnet

  complex:
    agent: claude
    model: opus
    # args:
    #   - "--dangerously-skip-permissions"

# Agent concurrency limits
# Controls how many instances of each agent can run simultaneously
agents:
  cursor-agent:
    max_concurrent: 2
