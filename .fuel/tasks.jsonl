Updated `InitCommand.php` to check if `tasks.jsonl` is empty before creating a starter task, wrapping lines 38-44 in `if ($taskService->all()->isEmpty())`.\n2. Added a test to verify idempotency: running `init` twice does not create duplicate starter tasks.\n3. All tests pass (including the new idempotency test).\n4. Code formatted with Pint.\n5. Committed changes: `44c389f`.\n6. Marked task `f-9c1dac` as done with the commit hash.\n\nThe `init` command is now idempotent: it only creates a starter task when `tasks.jsonl` is empty, preventing duplicates when run multiple times on an already-initialized project.\n"}
